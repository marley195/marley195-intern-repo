How do these roles collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?

- Kanban tends not to have prescribed roles, it promotes organic collaboration via its visual boards as team members can identify status of work, bottlenecks and update priorities of task on the go. This flexibility means that team members can readily help each other when required.
- Scrum on the other hand is more structured and collaboration is more concentrated around the agile ceremonies such as sprint planning and review, where team goals are aligned and reflections on improvements are made.

What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?

- As a mobile app developer it's my responsibility to design, build and maintain the mobile applications that meet users needs but also align with the clients vision. I will contribute to the agile processes by:
  - participating in agile ceremonies including stand-ups and review.
  - Collaborating with team members including Quality assureance and UX design team to address feedback or refine requirements.

How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?

- Quality Assurance: Both I and QA work with Product manager to define acceptance critieria for each user story.
- Product Manager: Work with to refine user stories, clarify requirements, provide technical input on feasibility.
- UX Designers: work with to ensure designs are feasible, offer feedback during prototyping.
- Agile PM/Scrum Master: I communicate blockers to Master, participate in ceremonies and work together to remove blockers or improvement development flow.
- Other Developers: I interact with other developers through code reviews, and pairing programming. Primilary we work together to solve difficult problems, mantain code quality and ensure consistency across the project.

Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.

- As i'm a mobile app developer my main contribution is by designing, building and maintaining features that can deliver value to our users. I work with the Product manager to refine requirements, collaborate with QA to ensurity quality and work with other developers to maintain code consistency.

Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.

- A role i will be working closely with will be QA, this is required to ensure features meet the defined acceptance criteria and function on all devices. To help improve teamwork I can involve QA as early as possible in the development cycle, This can be done by sharing prototypes or WIP builds for feedback. This also allows us to find potential issues sooner and reduces backtracking in the deveopment stage.
