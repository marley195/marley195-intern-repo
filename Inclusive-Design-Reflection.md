Who are considered vulnerable populations, and what challenges might they face in digital spaces?

- Vulnerable populations can be people with disabilitites, eldery individiauls, linguistic minorities and children/young people.
- Some challenges they face include accessibility barriers for websites, digital applications or tools that may not meet their accessibility standards.

What ethical considerations are important when designing or working with neurodivergent individuals?

- keeping a clean and minimal layout reduces cognitive load avoids an overwhelming user experience.
- Avoid having loud sounds, high-contrast of flashing visuals and excessive visual clutter. Also giving the user options to adjust colours font sizes and sounds levels helps respect sensory needs.
- To ensure clear and accessible communcation simple and straightforward language should be used while also offering information in different formats whether that be video, audio, text or icons to cater to different preferences.

How can you make interactions and content more accessible for people with ADHD or Autism? (e.g., simple language, predictable navigation, reducing cognitive load)

- Using simple languages while avoiding jargon or complex sentences ensures our content is more accessible for people with AHDH and/or Autism.
- Predictable navigation can be implemented by having consistent layouts throughout our application, this would mean keeping buttons consistent and in the smae position across pages and clear labeling.
- To reduce cognitive load we can limit the amount of information we feed the user at any given time, too many options may overstimulate the user and provoide an overwhelming or negative experience.

How can we support neurodivergent team members in a professional setting? (Hint: Be clear in communication, respect different working styles, and allow flexibility.)

- When communicating we should try to be clear, direct and unambiguous while avoiding vauge phrases. When required verbal communcation can be followed up with written notes/summaries such as daily stand-ups.
- Respecting Different working styles shows that we can recognise individual strengths of team members while avoiding a once size fits all approach, This will tailor working preferences to the user to give them the best environement to work in.
- Allowing flexibility in the workplace gives neurodivergent more control over their workspace allowing them to work in quiet workspaces or control over lighting etc.

How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?

- I can be more direct and explicit in my statements and expectations rather then relying on implied meaning.
- Respect processesing and response times, I can be rushed without meaning to, so i need to allow pauses and avoid interrupting team members.

What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?

- Lack of persoanlisation options e.g no control over sensory elements like colour contrast, notifications sounds.
- Not meeting WCAG standards: this could be in the form of missing alternative text, inaccessible keyboard navigation or poor contrast ratios.

What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?

- One change i could make would be to apply WCAG accessibility standards in all my work, doing so would reduce the number of vuilnerable population that would encounter difficulties when using my digitial products.

Read a first-person account from someone with ADHD or Autism about their experiences with productivity tools. (Hint: Look for blog posts, videos, or community discussions.)

- This task about the process of testing different productivty apps and how it can be mentally and emotionally draining similar to moving houses which resinates with myself as i have tried many. People can focus too much of searching on a new productivty app that hits all their marks instead of using their current app and setting it up in a way that suits them.

Identify one design or communication improvement that could make Focus Bear more accessible. 
- Improvements to the onboarding expereince to make it more fluid and less daunting to people with ADHD, this could be done by introducting features incrementally instead of loading all of them through the onboarding. This would help people from feeling overwelmed by the ammount of features that are in focus bear.


Practice writing a clear, patient, and supportive response to a hypothetical user struggling with executive functioning. 
- I know that it can be overwhelming to use the executive functions and thats fine, To help with this you could try breaking things down into smaller doable steps. Maybe try opening the app first and writing down what you want to start with. You need to remember that every action counts and helps build progress to your great tasks.
