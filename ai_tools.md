Which AI tools did you try?

- When looking at AI tools i tried and installed Github Copilot for VScode and Cursor two code assistance tools which are imbedded into IDE's but take on different roles, along with this i also tried ChatGPT for assistance with questions around coding conventions and style.

What worked well? What didn’t?

- While Github Copilot is good for assisting when writing sinlge files, it doesnt remember context surrounding the entire project which can make it generate some weird code which doesn't suit the style or context of other files, where as Cursor can be used to read my codebase/prject and provide suggestions with that context in mind. I found that Github Copilot could be good for sytax and general best coding convetions but wouldnt always provide good solutions to my problems whereas Cursor would provide better solutions but would often be overly complex.
- ChatGPT was useful for breaking down code snippets and gaining a deeper understanding into codebases and how they work, it was also great at giving overviews of debugging errors when outputs where hard to read. For this reason i find its best used for these areas and using the other two stated above to assist with simple code writing.

When do you think AI is most useful for coding?

- AI can be great when brainstorming ideas or assisting with debugging but it should not be heavily relied on, often it can halicunate or provide overly complex solutions to simple problems which arent needed. that being said as stated above for mundate tasks or trying think of alternative solutions to problems in can reveal different avenues to go down.
