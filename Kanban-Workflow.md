How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?

- Kanban board is a project management tool designed to visualise work. To manage workflow the kanban board implements columns to represents specifc activities such as in-progress or complete which cards (tasks) are placed into based on their status and WIP limits are estabilished to limit the number of cards in any given column.

What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent?

- Backlog: The tasks that need to be done.
- in-progress: The tasks that are currently being worked on by teams.
- Blocked: Generally tasks that are temporarily unworkable due to issues.
- Done: The tasks which have been finalised

How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?

- Tasks are moved across the board based on their status, when a task is planned it will start in backlog, when a team or team member starts working on a task they will move it to in-progress and once completed they will move it to done.
- Team members working on tasks are usually in charge of moving the tasks across the board

What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?

- Increased focus: With fewer tasks teams are forced to concentrate their efforts on completeing existing tasks before moving on to a new one.
- Faster delivery and reduced lead times: limiting the number of task ensure team members prioritises existing tasks before starting new ones.
- Improved quality: More focus is on each tasks ensuring higher quality of work.
- Better problem Identification as it's easier to identify bottlenecks and workflows.
- Enhanced Collaboration and communcation as teams are more aware of what each other is working on.

How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?

- Visualising work: By visualising tasks on a board teams can gain a clearer understanding of the work thats needed to be done and identify bottleneecks or potential improvements.
- Work in progress (WIP) limits: limits on the number of tasks that can be in-progress at any given time helps prevent overlead.
- Continouous improvement: Teams continuously reflect on their processes and make adjustments or improvements to increase their efficency and effectiveness.

How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?

- I can improve my workflow by visualing all work, this could be using Trello to make my tasks visible and would allow me to better track my tasks, their status and any potential blockers i may be facing.

- To improve my task tracking i could start by breaking larger features or requests into smaller more defined subtasks. This way i could then update their status providing a clearer insight into my progress of their feature. This would not only help me but also help my team better estimate the completeion timeline.
