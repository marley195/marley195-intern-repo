What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?

- How Focus Bear stands out from these other applications is that it combines habbit tracking and distraction blocking targeted for auADHD where as these other applications look to focus on a specific are whether that be to-do planning or disctraction blockers.

If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?

- This is hard to say without actually trying the other applications for a period of time. Having an quick review of the applications specifically Freedom, Tiimo and Routinery they all look to have quite clean UI but they do not provide all the features focus bear, this would be a reason i would choose Fear Bear over the competition to have distraction blocker, Habbit tracking and break notifications.

What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?

- One feature that would be a good addition to Focus bear would be a weekly planner for tasks/to-do lists similar to Tiimo's.

Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?

- As stated in my second answer i think one thing these other applications get right is their UI and ability to have widgets on IOS.
