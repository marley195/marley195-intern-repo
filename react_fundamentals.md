Challenges

- By using Vite to create a new react project the setup was quite smooth, Installing tailwind was a new process for me but with the help of https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite#react i was able to get my configuration template paths and directives setup correctly, if not for that assistance that would have beent he biggest challenge.

Importance of components

- They are the primary way to pass data from parent to child components.
- Using props allows components to be resuable.
- Allow components to render dynmaic content.

Modify state directly instead of setState

- If we modify the state directly it will update the counter variable in memory but wont re-render the component.

Common issues with lists

- Missing or incorrect key props.
- Mutating list state instead of replacing it e.g using push instead of set.
- Inocrrect delete or update logic. using filter can solve this issue.ÃŸ

Benfits of Client-side routing.

- Faster more responsive user experience as only new content needs to be fetched not entire page.
- Reduced server load as doesnt have to render entire page.
- supports browsing history.
- Unique URLS.
