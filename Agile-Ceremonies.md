Agile ceremonies for my role

- Daily standups: This will help me raise blockers which can help the team resolve bottlenecks.
- Sprint planning: Setting clear goals about which features/bug fixes or UI improvements are going to be prioritezed ensure that i can plan my work effectively.

Stand Up attended
- Attended daily standup that was lead by Aastha and Jeremy I was able to dicuss my progress i made made towards my assigned issue which was changing the position of the launcher button for andriod application and placing it on the tab bar. I was able to screen share to show my changes and got feedback from Jeremy to advise that it was a good adjustment and to move onto my next task.

Retrospective attended.
- The retrospective i attended was hosted by Jeremy and Aastha, we used the Miro for a collaborative retrospective template in which everyone could add sticky notes to the 4 areas, i was able to contribute a note in what went well in which i stated i was able to get both my andriod and IOS emulations up and running meaning i could now work on more diverse issues.

Actionable change for better collaboration
- Moving forward i plan to attend standups more frequently to ensure consistent updates are given, with some members going to 3+ a week they are able to get feedback more frequently allowing for faster development and resolutions on their issues.
