Which terminal client did you choose? Why?

- I'm most familar with Zsh on Mac as its been the terminal i use for other projects.

What customizations (if any) did you make?

- Changed the theme of my terminal to Ocean, i find that it adds more colour to the terminal while making it easier to look at.
- Added plugin zsh-autosuggestions which helps with speeding up command typing by autocompleting the comand to the closest suggestions.

What was the most useful command you learned today?

- Alot of commands that i read about had been commands i already used or do not have a need to use, however i have now set up Cursor to allow the cursor command from the terminal, which allows the cursor to open up directly from the terminal when run in in the project directory. I find this helps speeds up opening a project and ensures that the correct IDE is being opened.
