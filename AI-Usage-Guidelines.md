Identify one task you can improve using an AI tool.
- One thing i will use AI for to improve and speed up my workflow is syntax errors, AI such as cursor is great at picking up small syntax errors that can be otherwise hard to spot as they are great at pattern recognition. I have already implemented cursor into my workflow by using its agent to check over changes i have made to the FocusBear repository.

Review the AI-generated output criticallyâ€”did it require editing or fact-checking?
- When resolving Issue #3236 for FocusBear mobile-application repository i used AI to identify parent modals of the logquantitymodal and search for props which would be able to be used in the solution. Cursor was able to identify actionRequired prop which hadn't been used in the LogQuantityModal which would resolve the issue. Even though AI had identified a solution i still went back and review the parent component to ensure that it was correct in its solution and then tested it to ensure it provided the correct response.

Document one best practice you will follow when using AI tools at Focus Bear.

- As stated above even when using AI for small tasks it is alway important to review its solution and output to ensure it is not hallucinating and this is why I will always review, check and test the output of AI to ensure it is correct. Doing so ensure that the content is verified by a human before deployment.
