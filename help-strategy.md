Using AI vs searching Google.

- AI provides a strong starting point for gaining an overview of a topic, which can then be deepened through Google to build a more detailed understanding. It is particularly useful when debugging, as it can quickly break down large amounts of error information into a clear summary. If AI is unable to resolve the issue or the error is more complex or recent, I then turn to Google for up-to-date solutions and community insights.

When to ask a colleague

- Asking a colleague for assistance depends on several factors, such as the complexity of the problem, whether it requires knowledge of the entire repository, if sensitive information is involved, or if security is a concern. Whenever there is uncertainty in any of these areas, it is best to seek clarification or guidance from a colleague.

Challenges when troubleshoot alone

- Reduced perspective making it easy to overlook alternative paths solutions or not see a blind spot in the code.
- A lack of knowledge across call frameworks/libraries that have be used in the project.
- No code reviews or valiation of code causing reduced code quality.
- Can have the risk of tunnel vision causing time to be spent implementing the wrong solution.
- Lack of motivation working solo can cause a reduction in producivity.
