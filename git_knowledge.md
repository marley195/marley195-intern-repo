Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?

- I've used Github for all group assignments in year 2/3 of Uni, I have also been the cod owner of group repositories

Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?

- I either use Git via VS code if i want a visual representation of my commits otherwise i will use git via the terminal.

What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?

- I didnt know that GitHub had its own desktop application which you can use to manage local repositories.
