Agile Principles & Frameworks

What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?

- Traditional Project management generally is linear and sequential and works in long phases only delivering the project at the end of the project where as Agile management focueses on Itertaive development, customer collaboration, flexibility and continuous delivery ensuring that software deliverys happen often.

What are the core values and principles of Agile?

- Customer satification through early and continuous delivery.
- Welcome changing requirements throughout development.
- Deliver working software frequently.
- Business people and developers must work together throughout project
- Build projects around motivated people.
- Regular face-to-face conversations within development team.
- Working software is the main measure of progress.
- agile processes promote sustainable development.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity.
- self-organizing teams create the best architecture, requirements and designs.
- team reflection at regular intervals.

What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?

- Scum works on defined roles such as Scrum Master, Product Owner and Development team and fixed-length development cycles. Its main emphasis is on planning and regular ceremonies e.g daily stand-ups and sprint planning. Whereas Kanban follows a continuous delivery model with no fixed length development cycles, instead work items are visualised via a kanban board and managed through Work In Prorgress (WIP) limits.
- Scrum is ideal for teams building features in regular time-blocks, while kanban suits teams handling ongoing tasks or tasks needing flexibility.

Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?

- Given Focus Bears enivornemnt of being a startup a certain level of flexibility is required in their work when it comes to teams managing and priorities responsibilitys such as bug fixes and product evolution. Kanban provides this as development teams can address high priority tasks when they arise rather than commiting themselves to a fixed set of tasks.

What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?
Benefits

- Faster delivery of working software.
- Improved team collaboration.
- Increased adaptability with shifting requirements.
- High quality due to continiuous testing and feedback in the development cycle.

Challenges

- Managing consistent communcation across distributed teams.
- Scope creep from changing priorities.
- Predictability during the initial stages.
- Difficult to scale in larges business.
- Frequent customer interactions means they can be a blocker in unavailable.

How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?

- Implementing the agile prinicples can enhance my role as a mobile app developer by promoting a more collaborative and user-focused workflow, The use of sprints will allow me to deliver features quicker and gain frequent feedback from customers. working in my position i require regular communcation with other teams including backend developers and UX/UI designers which alligns with agiles principles.

Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.

- Scrum and Kanban are both agile methods but the differences are:
- Scrum uses sprints which generally last up to 4 weeks in which teams plan and commit to a specific list of backlog tasks. Scrum has pre-defined roles including Scrum Master, Product owner and development team. Ceremonies are held regularly including daily stand-ups, sprint planning and retrospectives whereas Kanban doesn't use sprints and instead more flexible and continuous and works based of visuals boards. Kanban implements Work In Progress (WIP) Limits.

Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.
Welcome changing priorities, even late in development.

- This principles encourages the flexilibity and allows for tasks priorities to shift based on user feedback and app store reviews which is crucial to mobile development where responsiveness to user needs is key to maintaining a successful product.
