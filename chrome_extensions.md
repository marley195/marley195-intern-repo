Which extensions did you install? Why?

- I already had React Developer tools, but on top of this i looked at downloading, Lighthouse an automated tool which will help me to identify areas in whcih i can improve perofrmance of web applications by autiing pages.
- a second extension i downloaded was Redux DevTools which can benefit me with debugging my applications state changes by allowing me to see the behavior in response to different actions.

What was the most useful thing you learned?

- Lighthouse was a tool i had not heard of nor had it been brought up in my web development classes. This would be beneifical when wanting to test web applications by acting as an auditor on the application. From there i can then use its report which is generated from these audits to identify potential work spots in my project or patterns i may want to avoid.
- As im running my project locally i had to run lighthouse via the Devtools tab which then provides an overall rating for 4 categories, perfmroance, accessiblity, best practices and SEO.
